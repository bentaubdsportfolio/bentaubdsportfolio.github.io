									<h1>Multimedia Thinking</h1>
									<p>This section is for various multimedia assignments done for my Multimedia Thinking course.<br />
									For this course we were tasked with picking an issue to address, so the issue I had chosen<br />
								was the over-simplification of fighting games.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>Photo Assignment</h2>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Digital Studies Portfolio/MMTPhotoProject-BenTaub.png" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="box">
									<p>With simplifying of fighting games, the game also changes making it difficult for pro
									players to adapt, things that were ingrained into their minds as to how to approach a fighting
									game, now are completely different or in some cases outright unnecessary, giving these players
									with years of experience the appearance of being bad. Even for Daigo Umehara, a long time pro
									in the fighting game community, also seen as the first to be that, was known as the best, no one
									could beat him, and even being known for saving fighting games as we know it. With this
									watering down of fighting games even he was referred to as a bad player, being ridiculed by
									many, despite all the accomplishments he has had in the past, with very few being able to
									approach his success.</p>
									<p>The picture I used was a headshot of Daigo Umehara, a pro fighting game player. With
									the text, I split it up between positive statements, and negative statements that people have used
									in reference to him. It is then finished off with a tag in the center, labeling him as a “Pro.” With
									the composition, I had the positive statements placed above him near his head, and had him look
									down on the negative statements, giving it more of a somber tone.</p>
								</div>
								<h2>Comic Assignment</h2>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Digital Studies Portfolio/MMT/Comic/this.png" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="box">
									<p>In my comic I used both screens from a game, as well as pictures taken from actual big
											tournaments. To have the images, which are mixed with both real life and non-real life, match
											better together on the paper I used a sketch filter so they would appear more similarly. Finally for
											the text, I repeated the phrase “I can win” over and over, however I left who is saying that and
											the connotation in which it is being used purposely ambiguous.</p>
									<p>Watering down the elements that make anything difficult can leave the pros worried for
											multiple reasons. Even newcomers who do not have nearly as much experience can still leave the
											pros worried with if they can win, which is why I left it ambiguous as to who was saying “I can
											win” in the comic. Also having the way you do things change so you are working harder than
											necessary can make it harder for the pros to succeed, so even the pros have to worry about
											whether they can win or lose to people who are just starting out.</p>

								<h2>Sound Assignment</h2>

								<div class="box">
									<p>In my sound, I took the sound of gameplay from a fighting game and put it over 2 other
											sounds: A cheering crowd and a booing crowd. With that was also overlaid 2 sets of button
											pressing sounds, one of mashing while the other is in a more rhythmic pattern. Neither of these
											sets of sounds are ever directed at a specific player of the game.</p>
											<p>For my sound, I purpose kept the recipient of the booing and who was mashing the
											buttons and who was pressing them rhythmically anonymous. By watering down how fighting
											games are played, the line between those who are novices and those who are experts are skewed.
											It will become harder and harder to determine this if fighting games are continued to be
											oversimplified.</p>

								<h2>Video Assignment</h2>

								<div class="box">
									<p>In my video I took one of the most, if not the most well known, influential moments from
											competitive fighting games and added some effects to it to make it look as though the video is
											deteriorating as the video progresses. Some of the effects used were blurring, noise, desaturation,
											reverb, etc. The idea behind this was to make it look like the video was becoming lost to time.</p>
									<p>The reason why this specific clip was so well known and loved is because on top of being
											exciting and interesting to watch, even those that are not familiar with the game can tell that what
											is going on is something that was difficult to do, it took skill. Lowering the skill ceiling of
											fighting games will make it so exciting moments like this won’t happen because there won’t be
											anything particularly hard to do that would get an audience hyped up and excited. These types of moments will
											be lost.</p>
