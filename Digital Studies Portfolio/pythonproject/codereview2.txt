I ran this a few times and "No Time for Family Racing Challenge" is my favorite so far. You have good, clean code here that runs and does what's expected. I think in the final phase of the project, try to ramp up what you can for the "ambition" category we discussed in class yesterday. As it is, this is clever but limited. What can you do to make it a bit more robust and engage a bit more with the issues you're raising?
