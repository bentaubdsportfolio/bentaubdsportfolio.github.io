You wrote good, clean code here that seems like it will be usable as-is in your final submission. I don't see any obvious errors or red flags. My concern, however, is with your documentation: recall that the assignment asks for a full introductory comment on the function you choose to write that explains not just what it does and why and where it fits into the larger scheme of your project. Remember that this project (and especially this first code review) isn't just about writing code but about documenting that code and the thinking behind it.
